The leaf stalks can grow over 40 cm long, the leaf margin is smooth or slightly undulate.<br/><br/>Several different forms of var. caladiifolia are in cultivation.

        "description": "EN;Barclaya longifolia, which belongs to the Nymphaceae family, is found in large parts of Southeast Asia. However, this plant does not form any floating leaves even though it is technically spoken a water lily. Its elongated, reddish to green, wavy leaves make it look like a Cryptocoryne at first glance, at least as long as the plant is still young. However, the plant soon grows to a size comparable to a large Echinodorus. There is a red and a green variety, the latter with a reddish leaf underside. The green variety grows a little larger than the red one.<br/><br/>Like other Nymphaeaceae, Barclaya longifolia can be kept small for a longer time when its roots are restricted, e.g. by planting into a small pot. In general, this Barclaya is a relatively undemanding plant as long as it gets sufficient light and warm water (not under 24 &#176;C). Normally, it absorbs sufficient nutrients from the water, but a substrate fertiliser is of advantage. Keep in mind that root-fed Barclaya longifolia tend to grow even larger.",

        "description": "EN;Blyxa aubertii is a true waterplant originating from southern Asia, from India to Japan and New Guinea, from Madagascar as well as East Africa and Australia. It has been introduced into the USA (Louisiana). It lives in diverse habitats, from rice paddies to fast-flowing rivers. Even though this plant has been long known in the hobby it is not very widespread in aquaristics. Blyxa echinosperma was seen as species of its own in former times, however, now it is regarded as variety of B. aubertii (B. aubertii var. echinosperma).<br/><br/>The cultivation of B. aubertii is not especially difficult. Even though it prefers intensive lighting it is not susceptible to nutrient deficiencies. As long as it gets enough CO2 and is subject to a well-balanced fertilising regimen it develops well in an aquarium. In a spot with direct light and provided with extra iron, B. aubertii can assume a chestnut colour. However, please keep in mind that this plant is fragile and should thus not be kept in overly strong currents or with boisterous fish in order to prevent it from looking tattered.",

Throughout its area of distribution, it can also be found in rice paddies. This Blyxa species has become a very familiar plant in the aquarium hobby due to its attractive, grasslike, bushy habit.<br/><br/>Its cultivation is not especially difficult, if some basic requirements are met: sufficient light (0.5-1 watt per litre or more), CO2 supply and fertilisation with nitrate, phosphate, potassium and micronutrients. When cultivated in optimal conditions and under sufficient light, the plant displays golden and reddish hues and a more compact growth habit. Under insufficient light, B. japonica grows higher and greener, with a more lanky habit. The plant develops a very large root system and likes its substrate rich in nutrients, or bottom fertilisers, respecitvely. When phosphate levels are high (1-2 mg per litre), it regularly shoots long stems with tiny white flowers.",

        "description": "EN;Cardamine lyrata is a bog plant originally distributed in East Asia (China, Japan, Korea, Far Eastern Russia) where it lives in moist places and on rivulets. It is a great plant for coldwater tanks as well as tropical tanks that are not kept too warm, which makes it a very popular, easy-to-obtain aquarium plant.<br/><br/>Japanese cress is a fast-growing creeping stem plant easy in cultivation. Its tendriouls stems carry light green kidney-shaped leaves. Under insufficient light (less than 0.5 watts per litre) the stems grow very thin and the leaves stay significantly smaller. C. lyrata grows well even without the addition of CO2, however, carbon dioxide fertilisation enhances growth. Leaf size seems to be dependent on temperature. Colder water of around 20 °C furthers the formation of larger leaves, whereas temperatures of around 24 °C and over result in tiny leaves.<br/><br/>C. lyrata grows like a climbing plant between all its neighbouring plants. On the nodes it grows roots, which are very often hardly visible due to its dense growth. Propagation is very easy - just cut off a part of the stem or a lateral shoot, which you re-plant into the substrate. This cutting throws new roots very quickly and starts growing.",

        "description": "EN;Ceratophyllum demersum, also known as hornwort or coontail, is a ubiquitous aquatic plant, a true cosmopolitan. It is found floating or anchored in the ground, in manifold stagnant to slow-flowing waterbodies. This plant has been used in aquaristics since the beginnings of the hobby.<br/><br/>C. demersum is in reality a collective name for a number of species, which can only safely be discerned from each other by the number of spines on their fruit. In the aquarium, these fruit do not form, as a rule.<br/>The adaptation of Ceratophyllum to a life under water is extreme. Its inconspicuous flowers open under water, and the pollen from the male flowers gets to the female flowers through the water (hydrophily).<br/><br/>The cultivation of C. demersum is easy. This plant is completely rootless and grows equally well floating under the water surface or anchored on the ground. In literature, special rhizoid shoots are described that grow on shoots with contact to the substrate and anchor the plant by entering the ground. It is not quite clear yet whether this phenomenon also occurs in the aquarium. <br/><a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Y9D1jvs3HI>Ceratophyllum Demersum & Ceratophyllum Submersum</a>",

Like the latter, it is distributed almost world-wide and grows mainly in stagnant waters rich in nutrients, some of which periodically fall dry. Considering its natural habitats in Central Europe we might safely say that it prefers overall warmer locations than C. demersum.<br/><br/>The leaves of C. submersum fork three- to fourfold and end in 6 to 8 threadlike tips. In comparison, the leaves of C. demersum fork only once or twice, ending in 3 to 4 tips. <br/>The leaves of C. submersum are generally finer, softer and more bendable than those of C. demersum, which are thicker, more brittle and often carry clearly distinguishable spikes. <br/>Whereas the stem of C. demersum can be of a more or less reddish brown colour, the stems of C. submersum are always light green. The light green leaves of C. submersum, however, may assume an orange brown tint under very strong light.<br/><a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Y9D1jvs3HI>Ceratophyllum Demersum & Ceratophyllum Submersum</a>",

Tropia company was the first aquatic plant nursery to add this plant to their product range and to distribute it commercially. All in all, this species is a variety of C. wendtii that's not so very common in the hobby.<br/><br/>The cultivation of Cryptocoryne wendtii 'Mi Oya' is quite easy. A substrate rich in nutrients enhances growth. Light plays a decisive role in the growth habit of this variety. Lots of light results in a horizontal leaf position, whereas little light prompts C. wendtii 'Mi Oya' to grow vertically.<br/>An addition of CO2 is not required. Cryptocoryne wendtii 'Mi Oya' does not tend to rot, like so many other representatives of the C. wendtii group.",

They are distributed in the area around Kandy city in the central highlands of Sri Lanka, where they grow on river banks. Their leaves are oblong-ovate to narrow-lanceolate, with an even, unpatterned medium green colour, which resemble those of Cryptocoryne parva but grow bigger (emersed to 25, submersed to 20 cm in height). The blade of the spathe (the pseudopetal) is rough to tuberculate and is quite variably coloured, often dark purple or reddish brown.<br/><br/>The plant described as Cryptocoryne lucens by H.C.D. De Wit in 1962 is one variety from the C. x willisii hybrid complex that is quite commonly found in the hobby. It has long been known as robust, relatively small-staying aquarium plant. The submersed form of this Cryptocoryne has very narrow, lanceolate leaf blades and differs thus from the plant a long time erroneously known as Cryptocoryne nevillii with its oblong, ovate to lanceolate leaves.",

It is considered endangered in some states. When kept under optimal conditions, it forms small pinkish pods in its axils. Its one-of-a-kind fine foliage makes it a very popular and rather widely spread aquarium plant.<br/><br/>All in all it is not difficult to cultivate, however, it has some requirements that ought to be met to make sure it grows well. There should be sufficient light, i.e. 0.6 - 1 watt per litre. Under less light, the lower parts of the plants tend to die off and rot away. However, please keep in mind that under more intensive light the plant will also need more iron and micronutrients. Faded, pale plants are a sure sign that Didiplis diandra suffers from an iron deficit. It is not absolutely necessary to add CO2, however, fertilising with CO2 results in considerably faster and healthier growth. Nitrate, phosphate and potassium have to be added in regular intervals, as well as iron and micronutrients, which Didiplis diandra craves. When kept in optimal conditions and under lots of light, Didiplis diandra shows colours from orange to red hues. Under less light, the plant tends to stay green.",

There it is a rather slow grower, but can reach over 50 cm in height given that it is provided with sufficient nutrients, which makes it suitable for rather large tanks. A substrate rich in nutrients is of advantage. The coarse submersed leaves on their long stalks are lanceaolate to obovate.

In nature, E. uruguayensis usually grows submersed and often forms large populations, covering the ground with a network of rhizomes. Sometimes the plant grows long-stemmed floating leaves with an oval or obovate blade. In the aquarium, E. uruguayensis does not grow leaves above the waterline either. <br/><br/>This beautiful rosulate plant requires medium light and a nutrient-rich substrate for fast and robust growth. Slightly acidic water, fertilisation with CO2 and temperatures between 18 and 24 &#176;C also have positive effects on its growth.<br/>Water hardness seems to be more or less irrelevant for this species. However, the reddish and blackish forms require a good supply of micronutrients (especially iron) in order to maintain their beautiful colours. It is possible yet sometimes difficult to cultivate this Echinodorus emersed. Its emersed rosettes stay significantly lower than those of the submersed form.

For propagation, the upper part of the stem is cut off (like you would do with other stem plants) and re-planted.

As we know from Najas species, the stems of E. fluctuans are very brittle, so be careful when trimming.<br/><br/>This special plant offers itself for a 'wild' natural aquarium layout, a style for which Eleocharis vivipara is also highly suitable.

It is also very widely spread in Africa, Asia and Australia, a highly variable species, and has also been introduced into the south of the USA and northern Italy. It has proven its value as an aquarium plant in the last years.<br/>This small Eriocaulon species needs a nutrient-rich substrate, as it uses mainly its large root system for nutrient absorbtion. The roots may reach the triple length of the leaves in this species. Its other requirements are typical for most aquarium plants of moderate difficulty: lighting intensity should be high, CO2 fertilisation is a must, and the plant should be supplied with nutrients (including nitrate, phosphate, potassium and trace elements) by the addition of a liquid fertiliser to the water. When CO2 supply is good, the centre of the leaf rosette assumes a golden hue.",

However, the creeping runners of Glossstigma have opposing leaves (2 leaves per node), those of Marsilea are alternate (1 leaf per node). Moreover, Glossostigma leaves posses a distinct midrib, whereas the veins of Marsilea are fan-shaped, comparable to the leaves of a Ginkgo tree.<br/>There is another Glosso species, closely related to G. elatinoides, Glossostigma diandrum. Its flowers have two stamina, those of G. elatinoides have four.<br/>G. elatinoides is relatively easy to cultivate given that it has enough light and CO2. Light intensity should be at least 0.5 watts per litre. Under sufficient light, Glosso forms runners quickly, covering the entire ground after a relatively short time. Under insufficient light, however, it tends to grow out long. For good growth it needs sufficient nitrate (5 mg/l or above), phosphate (0.5 mg/l or above) and sufficient iron as well as micronutrients. Nitrate deficiency leads to yellowish leaves, and the older leaves are shed before time, phosphate deficiency results in a significant growth reduction, and the plant assumes a distinct dark green hue.

The plant was discovered by Holger Windelov around 90 km to the East of Havana in a rocky river during the dry season. The dense, cushion-like population rooting in gravelly substrate was growing around 50 cm above the waterline, and he safely assumed that during the rainy season, the entire population is submersed in waters up to 1 m deep, with a strong current. <br/>Its leaf size of only four to three millimetres makes this Hemianthus species the smallest aquarium plant in the world. For several years it has been among the most popular aquascaping plants.<br/><br/>The majority of Hemianthus callitrichoides plants you can buy in the trade were cultivated emersed and have roundish leaves. In the axils, sometimes you can see tiny white flowers. The submersed form looks quite similar, with a low carpet- or cushionlike growth. Its leaves are smaller and a bit narrower. It has more or less upright but very short stems with opposite leaves (two leaves per node), and, at the same time, creeping as well as overhanging shoots. On both the latter, the leaves are frequently found to form whorls of three per node. <br/><br/>When planted in small patches a few centimetres apart in the well-lit foreground of an aquarium, Hemianthus callitrichoides grows to form a dense, bright green plant carpet within 3 to 4 weeks. Planted in an elevated place it forms decorative overhanging shots.<br/><br/>H. callitrichoides has a more compact growth in relation to light intensity. Its optimum temperature lies around 25 &#176;C, however, it also tolerates temperatures in the range between 20 and 28 &#176;C. It is not always necessary to fertilise H. callitrichoides with CO2, however, the plant grows much healthier with it. It is susceptible to iron deficiencies, whose symptoms are yellow shoot tips. It should also be supplied with a sufficient amount of macronutrients, especially nitrate. <br/><br/>Its relative hardiness and its very nice appearance make H. callitrichoides a highly attractive and recommendable aquarium plant. It is not only suitable for carpet-like structures in the foreground, but also for layouts with many stones as a nice accent in the crevices, where it reminds the onlooker of alpine cushion plants. It can even be attached to driftwood, where it forms large bright green cushions with overhanging shoots. This tiny plant is highly suitable for nano tanks.<br/>Under sufficiently intense light, Hemianthus callitrichoides can also be cultivated above the waterline, where it generally forms more compact cushions than under water. In an open tank, it may be attached along the waterline of driftwood or rocks sticking out of the water.",

        "description": "EN;Baby tears, known as Hemianthus micranthemoides (or Micranthemum micranthemoides) in the hobby for decades, was discovered to be Hemianthus glomeratus by Cavan Allen in early 2011.<br/>True Hemianthus micranthemoides is another species that has probably never been in aquarium cultivation. The last herbarium record of this plant from nature is from the year 1941, and the plant is considered missing and possibly extinct today. Hemianthus micranthemoides used to occur on the Atlantic coast of the USA between the states of Virginia and New York in fluvial tidal zones.<br/><br/>Hemianthus glomeratus, however, is endemic to Florida, where it can still be found in large numbers in its natural habitats. It grows, amongst others, in wet depressions and stagnant waters. Its emersed form, growing on wet soil, forms a dense, low, light green carpet of tiny creeping shoots.<br/>The two Hemianthus species native to North-America can be discerned by means of their flower characteristics:<br/>- H. glomeratus: Flowers are pollinated as soon as they are fully open (chasmogamous), calyx lobes are acute. <br/>- H. micranthemoides: Flowers remain closed and pollinate themselves (cleistogamous), calyx lobes are obtuse.<br/><br/>The leaves of H. glomeratus sometimes are crosswise opposite (2 leaves per stem node), however, most frequently grow in whorls of 3 to 4 leaves per node. The leaves of submersed plants are lanceolate to elliptical, 3 to 9 mm long and 2 to 4 mm wide. Emersed plants remain far smaller than those cultivated submersed, have elliptical leaves and develop a creeping growth habit. Only the land form grows tiny whiteish flowers.<br/><br/>Another Hemianthus species hitherto not closer identified but resembling H. glomeratus is in cultivation under the name 'Hemianthus micranthemoides'. It differs from H. glomeratus e.g. by having only two leaves per stem node. For more details, please to go Hemianthus sp. 'Amano Pearl Grass'.<br/><br/>H. glomeratus is a relatively undemanding plant that develops best under lots of light (approx. 0,5 watts per litre or more). Then it forms a dense bush with upright, slanted or even horizontal shoots. Under lower light, it grows vertically, forming long internodes. In well-lit aquaria it grows well even without the addition of CO2, however, when CO2 is injected into the tank its growth rate is higher and its habit bushier. If CO2 is deficient, greyish-white lime deposits may form on the leaves (biogenous decalcification). A regular supply of nitrate, phosphate, iron and micronutrients is of advantage, and higher phosphate levels of around 1 to 2 mg/l seem to induce the plant to form larger, more robust stems and to further growth. H. glomeratus is highly susceptible to fish medication containing Erythromycin or Tryptaflavin.",

        "description": "EN;Takashi Amano uses this Hemianthus under the name 'Pearl Grass' in his aquascapes. Neil Frank (USA), who got this plant in 1995 from T. Amano, thus calls it Hemianthus sp. 'Amano Pearl Grass'. Amongst aquarists in Germany it has become known as Hemianthus sp. 'Goettingen' in the last years. Hans-Georg Kramer (2009) gave this fresh green plant the German name Smaragd-Perlenkraut, which translates to emerald baby tears.<br/>Sometimes, this plant is erroneously sold as Hemianthus callitrichoides 'Cuba' in trade. The reason for this might be the fact that the emersed forms of H. callitrichoides 'Cuba' and this hitherto unidentified Hemianthus look very much the same, and might be confused with each other from time to time in aquatic plant nurseries. However, the difference becomes quite clear when the plants develop submersed shoots.<br/><br/>Commercially available 'H. micranthemoides' (H. glomeratus) has its leaves mostly in whorls of three or four, as well in its emersed as in its submersed form. Its submersed leaves are generally stronger bowed down as those of H. sp. 'Amano Pearl Grass'.<br/><br/>As a rule, the leaves of H. sp. 'Amano Pearl Grass' are opposite (2 leaves per node). Its emersed leaves are a little darker and more rounded with a hairier margin than those of H. glomeratus under the same conditions. As mentioned above, emersed H. sp. 'Amano Pearl Grass' looks confusingly similar to emersed Hemianthus callitrichoides 'Cuba'. The submersed leaves are straighter than those of H. glomeratus, but have more or less the same shape.<br/>Its growth habit resembles that of Hemianthus glomeratus, however, H. sp. 'Amano Pearl Grass' has a stronger tendency to sprout horizontal or slanted upright shoots. Groups of this plant look a bit more irregular and less 'orderly' than those of H. glomeratus.<br/><br/>This Hemianthus is comparable to Hemianthus glomeratus regarding aquarium cultivation and use in layouts, but seems to grow a little faster and to be more undemanding. However, if CO2 is insufficient its shoot tips tend to stop growing altogether, and grey lime deposits may form on the leaves (due to biogenic decalcification). It has also been reported to be susceptible to nitrate concentrations of over 10 mg/l [3]. Moderate light is sufficient, however, under more intensive light it develops a bushier growth habit and is easier to keep low. A flat carpet in the foreground is best realised with plants that were precultivated emersed.",

The trade name 'H. maritima' is also used for another pennywort used in aquarium (see Hydrocotyle cf. tripartita).<br/><br/>The leaves of H. sibthorpioides are similar to those of Brazilian pennywort (Hydrocotyle leucocephala) but are a lot smaller (between 1 and 2 cm wide). The shoots of H. sibthorpioides, like those of H. leucocephala, grow above the ground - another thing the two species have in common. The shoots of whorled pennywort (Hydrocotyle verticillata),however, also grow as rhizomes inside the substrate. <br/><br/>In the aquarium, Hydrocotyle sibthorpioides is a demanding plant with a trailing growth. It requires lots of light to grow healthily and to reach its maximal size. For successful cultivation, CO2 injection is also a must (20-30 mg/l), as well as the regular supply of nitrate, phophate, iron and micronutrients. A high phosphate level helps to prevent green spot algae from forming on the leaves. Hydrocotyle sibthorpioides cannot be cultivated in tanks with low light and no CO2 supplemented as it would decay and die there. In strongly lit tanks and abundant CO2 and nutrient supply this species may develop into a very fast grower.",

        "description": "EN;In the warmer regions of the Americas, Hydrocotyle verticillata is quite a common plant. It prefers very moist soils and also grows in shallow water. It differs from the more wide-spread H. leucocephala by the form of its leaves that are formed like a tiny parasol and have no slot.<br/><br/>Cultivating H. verticillata in an aquarium is not really difficult. One of the most important factors is light, as its height depends on light intensity. The more intense, the smaller the plant will stay. Apart from that, its demands regarding nutrients and CO2 supply are quite easy to meet. A balanced supply of nutrients and CO2 injection are beneficial to the plants growth, though. However, if abundant nutrients are added, unfortunately the dwarfism so many hobbyists covet in this plant will disappear and it will grow much larger leaves. <br/><br/>A striking difference to H. leucocephala is the submersed growth habit of H. verticillata. Its creeping runners grow along the substrate, forming a dense carpet. Use a sharp pair of scissors for foreground layout and maintenance and for trimming the plant or its runners.<br/><br/>Its unique growth habit of the leaves that remind of little parasols or mushrooms, and its low height make H. verticillata an ideal foreground plant. In larger aquaria, it may even be used as only foreground plant, in smaller tanks it lends itself to accentuation.",

There it grows on rivulets in the western coastal area on the foot of the Western Ghats (Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu), and in literature, findings of this plant are also documented for the north-Indian state Uttar Pradesh.<br/><br/>This plant differs from the Hygrophila species hitherto kept in aquaria in many respects. Its leaves of the emersed as well as the submersed form are pinnatilobed to pinnatisect and are thus highly decorative. Furthermore, the submersed leaves have a special colour reminding of some Cryptocoryne species: their upper side is brown to olive green with a light yellowish pattern where the lateral leaf veins fork off the midrib, their underside is of a Burgundy red.<br/>When cultivated submersed, H. pinnatifida develops upright shoots as well as runner-like creeping ones, which can attach to rocks or driftwood with their roots. At the end of these multiply ramified shoots, upright sprouts develop. They can remain rather short for a longer period of time, looking like a rosette then. The stems are of a brown colour and rather tough.<br/><br/>H. pinnatifida does ok under moderate light, however, more intensive lighting helps it grow more compact. A compact growth habit can also be furthered by regularly removing the shoot tips. A good nutrient and CO2 supply is recommendable. This Hygrophila is apparently quite susceptible to a potassium deficiency, whose symptoms are small needleprick-like holes in the older leaves.<br/>The substrate seems to be quite unimportant. The plant forms a rather small, not very deep root system. When pulling the plant out of the ground you will see that the roots attach to sand or gravel grains.",

        "description": "EN;Hygrophila polysperma 'Sunset', in Europe sold under the name 'Rosanervig', has its origins in the Danish aquatic plant nursery Tropica. One special characteristic of this variety are the white-coloured leaf veins. They are not the symptom of a nutrient deficiency, though. It is assumed that a virus prevents the tissue around the veins from producing chlorophyll. This virus specialises in this variety only and thus poses no danger at all for the rest of the aquarium plants. This variety of the so well-known robust Asian H. polysperma has become a very highly coveted aquarium plant.<br/><br/>This undemanding red-coloured plant is very interesting as it is probably the easiest plant of that hue in cultivation. It grows under almost any conditions. Temperatures between 18 and 28 &#176;C, pH values in the range of 5 to 8 and a water hardness of soft to hard are tolerated very well, which shows how adaptable this plant is. It does not require lots of light and CO2, however, when provided with these factors its reddish colour gets more intensive. Iron also plays an important role for the reddish hue, too, as the plant colour tends to fade to shades of pale white if there is insufficient iron in the water column.<br/><br/>Like so many other fast growers, this plant tends to grow horizontally along the substrate. In many cases, this habit is caused by lots of light and helps the plant to cover as much room as possible before it resumes vertical growth. You can easily prevent this phenomenon by planting the stems very densely or by increasing the phosphate (PO4) level in the tank. Propagation and trimming are very easy. Just cut off a shoot and re-plant it in the substrate. Cutting back the main shoot results in many lateral shoots, and thus frequent trimming results in beautiful very bushy plants.<br/><br/>Hydrophila polysperma 'Sunset', or 'Rosanervig' is a red stem plant with lots of potential. Its highly interesting colour structure makes it a true asset in the middle- and background of the aquarium. Its relatively small leaves of around 4 cm length make it a suitable plant for almost all tank sizes.",

Sufficient light is a basic requirement for successful cultivation, as is an ample nutrient supply. Micronutrients help to preserve the reddish colouration of the shoot tips and the leaf undersides.

Even though it may survive under moderate light, it grows spindly and greenish.<br/>It responds well to the addition of the macronutrients NO3 and PO4, however, they are not necessarily required. CO2 injection and micronutrient fertilisation are both not necessary either, however, Ludwigia palustris grows considerably more robust, healthy and colourful if they are added.<br/>Unlike so many other plants from temperate climates, Ludwigia palustris is very adaptable to different temperatures and also does well in warmer water. Lots of light and a substrate rich in nutrients induce an almost horizontal growth habit in this species, and further the formation of roots and a great number of lateral shoots.",

        "description": "EN;The classical aquarium plant Ludwigia repens originates from the south of the United States, Central Americal and the Caribbean, where it grows on the edges of all kinds of waterbodies (ditches, rivers, lakes, ponds). It frequently forms dense trailing populations in the shallow water, whose shoot tips grow over the water surface. In nature, L. repens is a highly variable (polymorph) species and hybridises easily with other Ludwigia species, which makes scientific identification of the various local forms very difficult.<br/><br/>Ludwigia repens is among the most common aquarium plants world-wide. There are several forms of this species in trade. An especially colourful variety with round leaves is sold under the name 'Ludwigia mesakana' or 'mesacana'. Allegedly, L. 'repens' 'Rubin' is not to be counted among the species L. repens but is rather close to L. glandulosa, and is supposed to be a hybrid (please see 'Ludwigia Rubin').<br/><br/>L. repens looks very similar to L. palustris and the hybrid L. palustris x repens, its main distinguishing characteristics is the flower structure of the emersed plant. The flowers of L. repens have four small yellow petals about as long as the green calyx tips, whereas in L. palustris the petals are completely absent (please see description of L. palustris). L. palustris x repens often forms less than four petals (or even none at all) shorter than the calyx tips. These petals are discarded very early in many cases. The leaf stalks of L. repens and L. palustris x repens are often comparatively shorter than those of L. palustris.<br/><br/>L. repens is one of the easiest-to-care-for red aquarium plants and grows well under relatively low light (0.4 watt per litre), and it does not need CO2 fertilisation. When planted under strong lights, it does not grow strictly upright but has a slated to horizontal habit, forming many lateral shoots. Its reddish colour is most intensive if it is not planted in the shade of other plants but gets sufficient light (0.5 watts per litre or above). Low levels of NO3 (approx. 5 mg/l), and a high phosphate content (1.5-2 mg/l) as well as a good provision of iron and micronutrients intensify the red hues of the plant even more. Some hobbyists have noticed that 9325 Kelvin light tubes also enhance the red colouration.",

Lysimachia nummularia 'Aurea' and Lysimachia nummularia are great indicator plants, as they need sufficient NO3 (>5 mg/l) to form robust healthy leaves of an intensive colour. Deficiencies cause the plant to stagnate.<br/><br/>Lysimachia nummularia 'Aurea' has a rather vertical growth habit and does not grow too bushy to the sides, and accordingly it does not grow too many lateral shoots. When allowed to reach the water surface it continues growing emersed. <br/>Lysimachia nummularia 'Aurea' can easily be propagated by cutting off the top or some of the few lateral shoots. These are planted in the substrate after trimming. In general, Lysimachia nummularia 'Aurea' forms quite a few roots on its nodes.<br/><br/>The ovate leaves of this stem plant are best presented in the middle- or background of an aquarium layout.

This species is relatively new as aquarium plant, even though its name has long been known in the hobby. True M. mattogrossense is all green, and was first imported from Eduador by Christel Kasselmann in 1990. Its popularity has been growing ever since due to its beauty and easy cultivation. It is relatively often found in trade now.<br/><br/>This milfoil is one of the easier-to-cultivate plants. At least medium light (0.5 watts per litre or above) should be provided, though. M. mattogrossense is especially suitable for medium-lit tanks with no CO2 injection. Even under these conditions, this milfoil will develop healthy, large, green leaf whorls. Under stronger light and continuous CO2 fertilisation it grows faster and forms overall bigger leaves.<br/>Nutrient-wise, M. mattogrossense is not picky, all it basically needs are a little NO3 and PO4. At higher nitrate (around 10 mg/l) and phosphate (1-2 mg/l) levels, the stems grow larger and more robust. If the shoot tips turn white, the plant urgently needs iron and micronutrients.<br/><br/>M. mattogrossense needs to be cut back very often due to its very strong growth. Cut off the shoot tip and re-plant it into the substrate, or throw it away and leave the rest of the plant to grow back. Propagation is very easy due to the large number of lateral shoots you can use as cuttings.<br/><br/>So far, this plant is not used very frequently in Nature Aquaria or Dutch-style tanks, even though its finely structured leaves and lush green colour give it a lot of potential as a background or filler plant. It is also an excellent choice for beginning hobbyists who are looking for an easy-to-keep, fast-growing and at the same time highly attractive stem plant.",

Orchard - after true, green M. mattogrossense had been imported from Ecuador by Christel Kasselmann in 1990.<br/><br/>M. tuberculatum is rather difficult in cultivation. It needs intensive light with at least 0.8 watts per litre, and CO2 injection is indispensable. Nitrates and phosphates should be maintained on a good level (5 to 15 and 1 to 2 mg/l, respectively). None of these main nutrients should ever fall to zero, otherwise the plant growth will be stunted. M. tuberculatum needs more iron and trace nutrients than most other stem plants. Without sufficient micronutrients the stems of this species remain very dark and small, and if there is an extreme deficit, the formative tissue of the shoot tip dies off. Under favourable conditions, the leaf whorls of M. tuberculatum can grow to a maximum diameter of around 10 cm and attain a rusty red colour.",

        "description": "EN;Nymphaea lotus 'red' or N. zenkeri 'red' is native to the African tropics, where it is found in stagnant waters like lakes or temporary ponds. In aquaristics, it is by far the most popular species of its genus, and correspondingly well available in trade. It is also known under the name red tiger lotus.<br/><br/>Nymphaea lotus 'red' is a bublous plant that grows submersed as well as floating leaves. Even if it grows under low light it is recommendable to provide it with more light if you want to prevent it from growing floating leaves. If it does grow floating leaves you should quickly act and cut them off. If the water lily once reaches the water surface it grows almost exclusively floating leaves.<br/>Continual cutting off these leaves will break this habit. A nutrient-rich soil is especially important for water lily cultivation. CO2 injection and the addition of liquid fertilisers are also welcomed. Under optimal conditions, Nymphaea lotus 'red' grows very large, and most hobbyists have to keep it in check. A very popular method is planting the water lily in a pot that is then placed in the aquarium substrate. The limited root space stunts the plant s growth. <br/><br/>N. lotus 'red' is mainly propagated by seed. Therefore, the plant must be allowed to form some floating leaves in order to form flowers. These flowers can be pollinated by hand and then produce the seeds.<br/>The bulb can also be cut apart, however, this should only be done if a second leaf crown has formed. This propagation method cannot be recommended, as the mother plant might die off.<br/><br/>The enormous size this plant can reach limits its use. However, its red colour contrasts beautifully against green plants, and its size makes it a good focal point. Nymphaea lotus 'red' requires a little maintenance, but then it is a beautiful aquarium plant, mainly for large tanks.",

        "description": "EN;Riccia fluitans aka crystalwort is a floating plant found in all the world. It was scientifically described and catalogised as early as 1753 by Linnaeus, however, Takashi Amano from Japan was the first to keep it submersed in his nature aquaria, using it as an epiphyte by tying it to wood and rocks with a thin fishing line. Thus, Riccia became one of the most favourite plants of plant aquaristis. Meanwhile it has found its way into most plant dealers product catalogues. There are four different varieties (originating from Japan, Europe, Thailand and Singapore), however, only the variety from Japan is suitable for submersed cultivation.<br/><br/>Riccia fluitans is easy to cultivate. Its wide distribution may be attributed to the fact that it tolerates a multitude of different environmental conditions, e.g. water hardness levels of very soft to really hard, pH values between 5 and 8 and temperatures of 15 to 30 °C. As a floating plant it doesnt require high light intensities, and there is no need to fertilise with CO2. However, when cultivated submersed, tied to rocks and wood, the crystalwort s hunger for light increases considerably, and it also needs more CO2. The plant likes a high nutrient supply, nitrate, phosphate, iron and potassium are a must.<br/><br/>When kept as a floater, your Riccia plant may soon develop into an unsightly cluster. It is easy to trim, though, just remove the parts you want gone. Many times, Riccia is brought into a tank fixed to objects like wood or rocks, however. A hairnet is a good means to do so. Riccia is laid on and then covered with the thin net. By weighing down the net with small rocks you can create a Riccia carpet in the foreground of your aquarium. Overgrown parts may be removed with a pair of scissors, thus you can prevent the lower parts of the plant from dying off due to lack of light, too.",

'Vietnam' are quite similar to those of Rotala wallichii. Moderate light leads to an overall green plant with red stems, whereas intensive light leads to a pretty golden colour. It also needs CO2 injection in order to grow well. The phosphate content of the water should be around 1 to 2 mg/l in order to obtain thicker stems, smaller internodes and a reddish tint. Iron and micronutrients should also be present in ample amounts.

        "description": "EN;Rotala sp. 'Nanjenshan' is a delicate fine-leaved plant originating from Taiwan, where it has only been found in a single location near Nanjenshan. In 1993 it was introduced by Dennerle. Up to now, the species affiliation of this Rotala could not be identified, as it has not been known to fruit. Fruit, however, are crucial for identifying Rotala species. According to the Plant Finder on APC, it might be a natural hybrid of Rotala rotundifolia and R. wallichii; what can be said is that these two species are indeed found on Taiwan island. <br/>R. sp. 'Nanjenshan' is well-established in aquaristics and can be obtained in trade quite easily. The location name is often misspelled ('Nanjean', 'Najean').<br/>This Rotala was originally introduced under the erroneous name 'Mayaca sellowiana', which is the reason why many people assume that this name is a synonym of R. sp. 'Nanjenshan'. This is incorrect, though, as true Mayaca sellowiana might look somewhat similar, but is a totally different plant species that has nothing to do with the genus Rotala.<br/><br/>The submersed very narrow-lineal leaves of Rotala sp. 'Nanjenshan' grow in whorls and are of a light green to reddish colour. They grow to a length of 1.5-2 cm and a width of 0.5-1 mm. The number of leaves per node varies from 3 to 6. The leaf tips are truncate and sometimes have two points, like in many other fine-leaved Rotala species. The stem is green.<br/>The emersed form of R. sp. 'Nanjeanshan' has a creeping habit. Some of the stems also grow upwards, and there are 2 to 4 leaves per node. The emersed leaves have a very short stalk and are elliptic to lanceolate, 0.5 to 1 cm long and 2 to 4 mm wide. Emersed plants may develop small flowers with only 1 mm large light purple petals in their leaf axils.<br/><br/>Like R. wallichii, which is a little more difficult in cultivation, R. sp. 'Nanjenshan' prefers soft water rich in CO2. Unhindered light and ample iron are important for the shoot tips to attain an intense reddish colour. Constant, well-planned fertilisation is crucial to prevent stunted growth and blackening. The plant may have some requirements, but it is not especially difficult in cultivation.",

        "description": "EN;Rotala wallichii is an elegant stem plant originating from soft, slightly acidic waters in South-Eastern Asia. Its inflorescence has bright purple flowers. Even though it is not quite easy in cultivation it is a highly popular plant.<br/><br/>R. wallichii needs lots of light, CO2 fertilisation and a well-balanced supply of nutrients to grow well. The light intensity should at least be 0.5 watts per litre in order for it to attain intensive colours and to support growth. A good supply of CO2, either with bio CO2 or a system using pressure bottles is indispensable. Rotala wallichii grows best if the nitrate level never falls to zero but does not exceed 10 to 15 mg per litre either. A high phosphate content of 1-2 mg per litre is preferred, as well as a good supply of iron and micronutrients.<br/>Under optimal growth conditions this plant rewards its keeper with stunning colours, ranging from intense pink over orange to deep red foliage with a diameter of 2 cm and more.<br/><br/>This Rotala species forms opulent finely-structured groups growing upwards. Those plant parts closest to the surface develop the most intensive colours and throw a large number of lateral shoots. If R. wallichii grows too large for your tank design you can just cut off the uppermost part and re-plant it in the substrate. Propagation is done by cuttings of top and lateral shoots. They grow new roots very fast if re-planted in the substrate and start growing again.<br/><br/>Colourful R. wallichii is used in Nature Aquaria and in Dutch-style tanks. It is a great red accent plant for the middle- or background of an aquarium. In order to get the best effect, three to five stems should be planted at a time so they grow to form beautifully dense groups.",

        "description": "EN;Sagittaria subulata originates from the east of the USA and from South-America, where it grows in fresh well as in brackish water. Especially in estuaries it has been known to form vast meadows.<br/>S. subulata is very easy in cultivation, only needs moderate light and tolerates rather hard alkaline water. It grows well in aquaria without CO2 injection, even though the addition of CO2 helps growth immensely. A substrate rich in nutrients or water with a high concentration of nitrate, phosphate, potassium, iron and trace elements lead to strongest growth. This plant is especially susceptible to iron deficiencies, which shows in a yellow discolouration of the leaves. Intensive light causes the shoot tips to attain a reddish tint.<br/>When densely planted, the leaves can grow to a length of up to 60 cm. Less dense groups will result in lesser growth of only 5 to 10 cm. S. subulata is a fast grower spreading by runners, and able to form a dense carpet after a short time. Sometimes the plant grows long flower stalks that reach the water surface, where they sprout tiny white flowers.",

It was introduced to aquaristics under the name Tonina sp. 'Belém' by the Japanese company Rayon Vert. The name affix relates to the Brazilian city of Belém near which the plant was discovered.<br/><br/>Whereas Tonina fluviatilis, so far the only species in the genus Tonina, develops short-stalked flowers in the leaf axils along the stem, Syngonanthus species have long-stalked head-shaped flowers that appear in groups on the shoot tip, like the species in the genus Eriocaulon.<br/><br/>Syngonanthus macrocaulon is one of the most dificult plants to keep in an aquarium. It needs highly intensive light (around 1 watt per litre), the addition of CO2 and soft water (GH and KH not over 5). Like Tonina fluviatilis and Syngonanthus sp. 'Manaus', this plant also needs a slightly acidic substrate. Sufficient iron in the water is also very important to maintain its bright green colour.<br/><br/>The vertical growth of S. macrocaulon is moderately fast, as the plant rather applies its energy to the development of lateral shoots. When trimming, it is important to only cut the uppermost 4 cm of the stem to re-plant them in the substrate. Longer cuttings grow roots on the entire lower part of the stem, which looks rather ugly. Short cuttings grow better and look more beautiful in its further development.",

It was first imported by Japanese aquarists who realised its beauty and suitability for aquatic layouts. Even though T. fluviatilis is still quite new in the hobby, it has been gaining increasing popularity and is now more and more frequently found in trade. <br/>T. fluviatilis is the only species of the genus Tonina. It has a certain variability, and various location varietys are known whose habit differs a little. Some other stem-forming Eriocaulacea have erroneously been introduced to the hobby as Tonina species (for Tonina sp. 'Belem' and T. sp. 'Manaus', please see Syngonanthus macrocaulon and Syngonanthus cf. inundatus). <br/>T. fluviatilis has quite special requirements for cultivation and is not a beginner s plant. First and foremost, this stem plant needs moderately soft water. A total hardness of around 5 or below is favourable. The substrate reactivity needs to be acidic. The plant needs a lot of light (1 watt per litre or more). CO2 injection is a must. Surprisingly, T. fluviatilis is not really finicky when it comes to the amount of liquid fertiliser, apart from an ample supply of iron and micronutrients. However, nitrate and phosphate levels should never fall to zero in any case. <br/>Its special requirements sometimes cause planted tank keepers to set up an extra tank especially for T. fluviatilis and other plant with similar requirements (i.e. soft water and an acidic substrate, like Syngonanthus and Eriocaulon species etc.).",

It is most often introduced involuntarily. This bladderwort forms floating cushions under the water surface, but it can also settle between other plants or grown emersed on wet ground.<br/><br/>U. gibba does not have any finely pinnate leaves growing in whorls like most other aquatic bladderwort species but tiny, almost stunted-looking leaflets that grow sparsely on the threadlike, thin stems. These leaves carry the bladder traps that serve the plant for catching its prey, which consists of tiny aquatic organisms; fish fry or shrimplets are completely safe from these tiny bladder traps, and the tangled U. gibba plants provide them with some great cover.<br/><br/>However, this bladderwort may soon become a nuisance, and many an aquascaper has already cursed it, as it is often interwoven with other plants due to its tangled growth habit.

        "description": "EN;Weeping Moss is said to have been imported from China. It was identified as Vesicularia ferrei by Prof. B.C. Tan (Singapore). This species is also distributed in the south of Japan. In nature it has a creeping habit and grows on wet rocks covered with sandy soil, on moist riverbanks and on wet soil on rivulets. (1). <br/><br/>The submersed form of this moss can be identified on its clearly overhanging frondshaped shoots (see photos) that remind of a weeping willow. <br/>The leaves and the relatively broad leaf cells look rather ike those of V. montagnei ('Christmas moss'), however, the leaves do not end in an acuminate tip but are more acute and relatively obtuse. V. montagnei as well as other Vesicularia species may also develop overhanging shoots, but not as bent as those of V. ferriei, whose shoots are clearly bent downward. Under very low light its growth habit may be more horizontally, though.<br/><br/>Vesicularia ferriei first became popular with hobbyists and aquascapers in Asia, but as it is relatively undemanding regarding lighting and fertilisation, and thanks to its beautiful looks it has also spread to European aquaria very soon. Unfortunately, true weeping moss is hard to come by, as there are many other mosses that are also sold under that name, which do not even have the typical weeping growth habit.<br/>",

Like 'Christmas moss' (Vesicularia montagnei), V. reticulata is widely distributed in the Asian tropics, where it is found in moist habitats. Under the microscope you can see that the leaves of this plant are ovate to lanceolate with an apiculate long tip. <br/><br/>However, not only Vesicularia reticulata appears to be traded under the name erect moss, but also a Taxiphyllum species with an upright growth habit. On the other hand, the moss erroneously sold under the name 'Craton(n)euron filicinum' could be in fact V. reticulata.<br/><br/>As aquarium plant, V. reticulata grows best with moderate to intensive light.",
